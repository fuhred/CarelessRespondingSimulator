# Careless Responding Simulator
 
This is a companion to the article "Careless responding: Why many findings are spurious or spuriously inflated".  

This ShinyApp dynamically demonstrates how the introduction of Careless Responding can distort true effects. Users can define the parameters of a true effect (as well as other parameters). The plot automatically updates to show how a true correlation changes with the addition of careless responders. There are also simulation presets that demonstrate a diluted effect, an inflated effect, and a created effect. The app was implemented using the R package shiny. It can be accessed online at [https://fuhred.shinyapps.io/CarelessRespondingSimulator](https://fuhred.shinyapps.io/CarelessRespondingSimulator).
